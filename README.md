# 🛠️ Development Branch - Sprint 5 Angular Landing Page

This is the **development branch** of the Sprint 5 Angular project. All feature branches are merged here once they are tested and validated.

## ⚙️ Purpose

This branch acts as the main integration point for all ongoing work. It may contain unfinished components or experimental implementations before being finalized and pushed to `main`.

## 🌱 Workflow

The Git workflow for this project follows a structured branching strategy:

- `main` → Final, production-ready code
- `develop` → Active development branch
- `feature/*` → Feature branches for individual components or tasks

### Example branches:

- `feature/navbar`
- `feature/hero-section`
- `feature/footer`
- `feature/contact-form`

---

## 🧱 What is being worked on?

> The original HTML/CSS landing page is being progressively reconstructed in Angular. Each section is built as an independent Angular component and styled accordingly.

---

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

Once a `feature/*` branch is completed:
1. It is merged into `develop`
2. The whole page is tested for functionality and layout
3. When all features are complete and tested, `develop` is merged into `main`
