# 🚀 Sprint 5 - Angular Landing Page

This project is part of **Sprint 5 of the IT Academy bootcamp** and aims to **rebuild a landing page originally made with HTML and CSS**, now using the **Angular framework** from scratch.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Learn the fundamentals of Angular through a real-world example.
- Understand the internal structure of an Angular project.
- Divide the layout into **reusable and modular components**.
- Apply best practices with Git and branch management.
- Integrate traditional HTML into Angular's component logic.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) (v17+)
- TypeScript
- HTML5 + CSS3
- Git & GitHub

## 🌿 Branch Structure

This repository follows a clear and organized branching strategy:

- `main` → Production-ready, clean and working code only
- `develop` → Active development branch
- `feature/*` → Feature branches for each component or section  
  (e.g., `feature/navbar`, `feature/footer`, etc.)

## 📦 Project Highlights

- 🧱 Angular project scaffolded with `npx @angular/cli`
- 📁 Modular structure with clean separation of components
- 💡 Educational commits with step-by-step explanations
- 🛠️ Git workflow following best practices

## 📝 Current Status
